<p>{{ page.site_title }} is a <strong>community effort</strong> to disseminate security information on Industrial Control Systems. {{ page.site_title }} is not affiliated or linked with a governmental or commercial partner. Membership of {{ page.site_title }} is <strong>free</strong> and grants you access to a <a href="/threats.html">MISP</a> and <a href="/advisories.html">OpenCVE</a> instance. In return for membership we ask you to submit content to the ICS threat data.</p>

<h3>Access and sharing conditions</h3>
<p>Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:{{ page.site_mail }}?subject=BecomeMember">{{ page.site_mail }}</a>, describe how you can contribute and after a validation process you will get login credentials for MISP and OpenCVE. Use your professional or corporate email address and optionally attach your public PGP or S/MIME key. The MISP accounts require authentication with <strong>OTP</strong>. Accounts are setup for name-based addresses (*your.name@company.com*), and not for generic addresses (*info@company.com*).</p>

<p>Events and information are shared under the conditions of the <a href="https://www.circl.lu/pub/traffic-light-protocol/">Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)</a>. Every participant is obliged to comply with the classification. Naturally, you are responsible for the information you share. In your request e-mail acknowledge that you <strong>agree with these sharing and classification conditions</strong>, and educate the users of the organisation you will be MISP OrgAdmin for about those rules, too. The acknowledgement is <strong>mandatory</strong> for processing the request.</p>

<p>If you already have a MISP instance installed (which is usually more convenient for automation), you can also already provide us the MISP UUID of your organization.</p>

<h3>MISP events</h3>
<p>The MISP instance is *bootstrapped* with ICS relevant events shared under tlp:clear (tlp:white).</p>
<p>There is an automatic curation process for events synchronised from other MISP servers, this includes checks with MISP warninglists and the CIRCL Hashlookup service. Only events tagged with **workflow:state=complete** are considered complete and ready to be used.</p>
