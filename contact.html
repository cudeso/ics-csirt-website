<p>{{ page.site_title }} is a <strong>community effort</strong> to disseminate security information on Industrial Control Systems. {{ page.site_title }} is not affiliated or linked with a governmental or commercial partner. Membership of {{ page.site_title }} is <strong>free</strong> and grants you access to a <a href="/threats.html">MISP</a> and <a href="/advisories.html">OpenCVE</a> instance. In return for membership we ask you to submit content to the ICS threat data.</p>

<h3>Access conditions</h3>
<p>Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:{{ page.site_mail }}?subject=BecomeMember">{{ page.site_mail }}</a>, describe how you can contribute and after a validation process you will get login credentials for MISP and OpenCVE. Use your professional or corporate email address and optionally attach your public PGP or S/MIME key. The MISP accounts require authentication with <strong>OTP</strong>. Accounts are setup for name-based addresses (<i>your.name@company.com</i>), and not for generic addresses (<i>info@company.com</i>).</p>
<p>If you already have a MISP instance installed (which is usually more convenient for automation), you can also already provide us the MISP UUID of your organization.</p>

<p>Events and information are shared under the conditions of the <a href="https://www.circl.lu/pub/traffic-light-protocol/">Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)</a>. Every participant is obliged to comply with the classification. Naturally, you are responsible for the information you share. 
Acknowledge via <strong>e-mail</strong> that you <strong>agree with the sharing and classification conditions</strong>, and educate the users of your (MISP) organisationo. The acknowledgement is <strong>mandatory</strong> for processing the request.</p>

<h3>MISP events</h3>
<p>The MISP instance is <i>bootstrapped</i> with ICS relevant events shared under tlp:clear (tlp:white). It is then up to the community to further add relevant events.</p>
<p>There is an automatic curation process for events synchronised from other MISP servers, this includes checks with MISP warninglists and the CIRCL Hashlookup service. Only events tagged with <strong>workflow:state=complete</strong> are considered complete and ready to be used.</p>
