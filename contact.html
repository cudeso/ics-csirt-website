<p>{{ page.site_title }} is a <strong>community effort</strong> to disseminate security information on Industrial Control Systems. {{ page.site_title }} is not affiliated or linked with a governmental or commercial partner. Membership of {{ page.site_title }} is <strong>free</strong> and grants you access to a <a href="/threats.html">MISP</a> and <a href="/advisories.html">OpenCVE</a> instance. In return for membership we ask you to submit content to the ICS threat data.</p>

<h3>Access and sharing conditions</h3>
<p>Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:{{ page.site_mail }}?subject=BecomeMember">{{ page.site_mail }}</a>, describe how you can contribute and after a validation process you will get login credentials for MISP and OpenCVE. Use your professional or corporate email address and optionally attach your public PGP or S/MIME key.</p>

<p>Events and information are often shared under the conditions of the <a href="https://www.circl.lu/pub/traffic-light-protocol/">Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)</a>. Every participant is obliged to comply with the classification. Naturally, you are responsible for the information you share. In your request e-mail acknowledge that you <strong>agree with these sharing and classification conditions</strong>, and educate the users of the organisation you will be MISP OrgAdmin for about those rules, too. The acknowledgement is <strong>mandatory</strong> for processing the request.</p>

<p>PS.: If you already have a MISP instance installed (which is usually more convenient for automation), you could also already provide us the MISP UUID of your organization.</p>
