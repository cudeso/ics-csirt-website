### Ransomware

<p>
- Ransomware will remain the No. 1 scourge of industrial enterprises in 2024.
- Ransomware attacks on large organizations, suppliers of unique products (equipment, materials), or big logistics and transport companies can have severe economic and social consequences.
- The ransomware market is heading for a peak, which may be followed by a decline or stagnation. 
  - Attacks on logistics and transport companies may become targeted not at the IT infrastructure supporting operations, but the vehicles themselves (cars, ships).
  - The same vector applies equally to owners and operators of various specialized equipment operating at remote hard-to-reach sites, such as in mining or agriculture.

### Hacktivists

- Politically motivated hacktivism along geopolitical fault lines will grow sharper teeth and have more destructive consequences.
- In addition to protest movements within countries against a backdrop of rising social tension (caused by religious and ethnic strife and growing economic instability in many regions of the planet), we will see growing cosmopolitical protest hacktivism, such as that driven by—or, conversely, aimed against—the introduction of a new socio-cultural and macro-economic agenda.
- The overall rise of hacktivism across the globe will inspire more individuals and groups to start their own fight for “whatever”, even “just for fun”.

### From grey zone towards the shadows

- Widespread use of “offensive cybersecurity” for gathering cyberthreat intelligence will have both positive and negative consequences.

### Threats related to logistics and transport

- The ongoing and rapid automation and digitization of logistics and transport will lead to:
  - Greater intertwining of cyber- and traditional crime, particularly in long-established criminal fields
    - Theft of cars
    - Maritime piracy and logistical disruptions
    - Theft of goods using cyber means.
    - Smuggling powered by cyber-means—as the development of tactics used in the notorious “Ocean’s Thirteen” case in the port of Antwerp.
  - Increased likelihood of physical consequences of non-targeted attacks.
    - Known cases of vehicles of various types being infected with malware
