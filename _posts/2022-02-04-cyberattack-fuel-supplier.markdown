A [posting from Malwarebytes](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/vital-infrastructure/2022/02/cyberattack-on-fuel-supplier-causes-supply-chain-disruption/) reports that : a cyberattack has disrupted the activities in Germany of fuel supplier Oiltanking Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG. The supplier is, among others, responsible for deliveries to the thousands of Shell and Aral gas stations in Germany. The Oiltanking division of Hamburg-based Marquard & Bahls owns and operates 45 terminals in 20 countries. As far as we know only German branches of the firm are affected by the attack.

Around the same time Dutch and Belgian media reported that at least 6 oil terminals run by SEA-Tank, Oiltanking, and Evos in the harbors of Antwerp, Ghent, Amsterdam and Terneuzen are experiencing IT problems.

Some news sites reported that this was related to the Blackcat ransomware.

Further news and threat indicators as well as indicators to detect the activity are published in MISP.
